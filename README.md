Title: The World in a Snow-globe: A Physical Interactive Digital Globe for everyone

The goal of this research is to show how anyone can design and build a smaller and more cost effective do-it-yourself physical interactive digital globe that projects a map from a web browser into a spherical globe. This is a very similar project to one that Nirav Patel built in 2011, except, using a smaller globe size coated differently to see if it can display a higher quality resolution image that can match the quality of the commercially available Omniglobe and iGlobe.

Open source hardware and software has been used, modified and enhanced to support this project. The research resulted in a 6‚Äù PIDG being built using a mobile projector, a fisheye lens, open-source hardware to create a 3D printed mounting bracket and open-source software to create the globe image displayed in the sphere
